# WineRecommender

This is the referenced homepage for the WineBot Twitter bot that implements the Machine Learning Sommelier project. 

The main page displays tabuler and graphical data from Tableau. An online Tableau login is required to see the data.
The BOT recommends a wine variety, and this Tableau graph allows the user to filter by variety. The user can see the wineries from each 
country that produce the wine variety selected. Furthermore, for each winery, a graph shows the average points awarded to the wine variety 
and its average price. The graph is interactive because it was generated from Tableau. When hovering over a tabular bar, the tooltip
elaborates on all the data displayed.

The About page explains the project and the various code components (Twitter BOT, machine learning neural network, and the Tableau graphs).
